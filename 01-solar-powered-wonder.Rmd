# Solar Powered Wonders

Plants are solar powered wonders. They harvest energy from (Sun)light, carbon dioxide from the air, water from the ground and use them to produce food and fibers (carbohydrates) in a process named photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis can be described by this simple chemical reaction:

```
carbon dioxide + water --sunlight--> carbohydrates + oxygen
```

Which indeed might help you conceptualize photosynthesis. But this reaction does not illustrate what a complex and sophisticated process photosynthesis actually is. Photosynthesis is an intricated biochemical process that requires coordination of hundreds of biochemical reaction in an environment specifically designed (ehm... evolved) to host them: the plant leaf ^[Actually, this is imprecise. For our aim we will restrict our attention to the plant leaf, but photosynthesis is not limited to leaves and does not depend on them. A big portion of photosynthesis on Earth is carried out by algae and bacteria.].

The plant leaves intercept sunlight, manage gas exchange between the plant and the environment and bring water and nutrients to the photosynthetic apparatus. Leaf cells contain the full photosynthetic apparatus, or many of them. Every leaf cell is capable to run photosynthesis rather autonomously, which means that it can build all the component necessary to run the photosynthetic machinery and coordinate them.

You will forgive me if I do not explain in detail the component of the photosynthetic machinery or their functioning. In brief, those components intercept light and use it to oxydize water and to build electrochemical potential that will be used to fuel another series of biochemical reactions that convert carbon dioxyde into sugar. If you want to explore this process in detail, I can suggest [this wikibook on biology](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Biology%2C_Answering_the_Big_Questions_of_Life/Photosynthesis) or a series of videos lessons from [MIT](https://www.youtube.com/user/MIT/search?query=photosynthesis) and [Khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/photosynthesis-in-plants).

Besides chatching a glimpse of the complexity of phothosynthesis, we are mainly interested in one of its other aspects: while the main concept of photosynthesis and most of its component are the same in all plants,  every plant species contains different small modifications that adapt and finely tunes these components and this process to its need. We are going to investigate this adaptation and fine tuning in detail.
