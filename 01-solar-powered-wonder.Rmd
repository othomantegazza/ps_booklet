# Solar Powered Wonders

Plants are solar powered wonders. They harvest energy from (Sun)light, carbon dioxide from the air, water from the ground and use them to produce food and fibers (carbohydrates) in a process named photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis can be described by this simple chemical reaction:

```
carbon dioxide + water --sunlight--> carbohydrates + oxygen
```

Which indeed might help you conceptualize photosyntheisis. But this reaction does not illustrate what a complex and sophisticated process photosynthesis actually is. Photosynthesis is an intricated biochemical process that requires coordination of hundreds of biochemical reaction in an environment specifically designed (ehm, evolved) to host them: the plant leaf ^[Actually, this is imprecise. For our aim we will restrict our attention to the plant leaf, but photosynthesis is not limited to leaves and does not depend on them. A big portion of photosynthetic activity on Earth is carried out by algae and bacteria.].

The plant leaves intercept sunlight, manage gas exchange between the plant and the environment and bring water and nutrients to the photosynthetic apparatus. The full photosynthetic apparatus, or many of them, resides inside the leaf cells. Every cell is capable to run photosynthesis rather autonomously, which means that it can that build all the component necessary to run the photosynthetic machinery and coordinate them.

You will forgive me if I do not explain in detail the component of the photosynthetic machinery or its functioning. In brief, this components intercept light and use it to oxydize water and to build electrochemical potential that will be used fuel another series of biochemical reaction that turn carbon dioxyde into sugar. **where do they explain details of photosynthesis.**

Besides chatching a glimpse of the complexity of phothosynthesis, we are mainly interested in another of its aspect: The main concept of photosynthesis and most of its component are the same in all plants, but, but every plant species contains different small modifications that adapt and finely tunes these components to its need. And it is this fine tuning that we are going to investigate in detail.
