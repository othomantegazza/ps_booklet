# Digging for Information

Photosynthesis is like an engine, we want to understand its details. Unfortunately photosynthesis is a molecular machinery, and thus it its components are very small and not very easy to study.

There are many methods to study this microscopic biological processes, molecular machinery and all biological organisms and subcellular parts that are too small to be seen.

Some methods are as powerful an unexpected and unintuitive. One method that was established a couple of decades ago and constantly improved and refined is transcriptomic analysis.

We are using trancsriptomic analysis to study photosynthesis and it variation, especially C4.

To understand transcriptomic analysis we have to go back to the engine factory analogy.
