Plants collect energy from sunlight and use it to produce fruits that we eat, fibers that we wear and much, much more; in a process called photosynthesis.

This process is fundamental for our life on Earth, and it has been [intensively studied for centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis#Discovery) by scientists. We, scientists at [CEPLAS](http://ceplas.eu), are also contributing.

Here I'll give you a glimpse into our scientific research. After a very short introduction to photsynthesis, I'll explain to you one its details of and one method that we are using to investigate it.

The method is called transcriptomic analysis and we are using it to investigate a special adaptation of photosynthesis for warm and dry weather.
