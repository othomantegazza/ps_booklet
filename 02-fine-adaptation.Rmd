# Fine Adaptation

While the main aspects of photosynthesis are the same in all plants, every plant adapts its leaves and its photosynthetic apparatus to specific environmental conditions.

The leaves of every plant are exposed and provide limited protection from the surrounding environment. If the surrounding environment changes, photosynthesis must be adapted. For example sunlight intensity changes regularly and cycles throughout the day and the year. Wind, temperature, humidity also change, sometimes in an unexpected way, but most of the time those changes are expected and can be easily predicted. Atmospheric condition cycle throughout the day, plants must be ready and adapt their photosynthetic apparatus dynamically to meet those conditions.

There is another layer of complexity: environmental conditions change, but every geographical area has a typical climate, a range atmospheric conditions that are expected throughout the year. Examples of climates are tropical, mediterranean, subartic etc. To thrive, a plant must be stably adapted to one climate region, the one in which evolved. The typical challenges that one climate poses to photosynthesis are different from the ones of other climates.

So there are two levels of adaptation. Photosynthesis must be dynamically adapted to ever changing atmospheric conditions, but at the same time, photosynthesis must be also stably adapted and tuned toward the challenges of a certain climate, the one in which that plant species evolved. It is about stable adaptation of photosynthesis that we are interested.

We study fine stable adaptation of photosynthesis for a simple reason: crop plants are often grown in environments and regions that are different from the one in which they evolved. If we understood how crop plants adapted to their old environments we would know how they could adapt to new growing conditions. Optimization of photosynthesis is considered a path toward growing healthy crop plants with less water and less fertilizers.

To explain this I will use the similarity of an engine and a factory. I know that comparing photosynthesis to an engine does convey the wonder that we feel when we observe living organisms. But for our purposes, this similarity works ridicolously well.



## Photosynthesis Like an Engine

No, it is not. Actually photosynthesis is the exact opposite of an engine. Where an engine burns, photosynthesis unburns. Our combustion engines today burn very recent or very old products of photosynthesis.

But as an engine converts some form of energy into another, with a very rigorous process and a very standard set of parts, so does photosynthesis.

### Similarities

So, for example, as a combustion engine has a core concept involving:

- a specific chemical reaction that releases heat (CH + O2 --> CO2 + H2O),
- A tank to store the fuel,
- a carburator and cylinders in which the fuel is burnt
- a crankshaft that converts the up and down motion from the pistons into rotational motion.

So photosynthesis has:

- a specifical chemical reaction that is powered by light (CO2 + H2O --> CH2O + O2) ... noticed the similarity?
- An antenna structure that harvest the sunlight (that contains the green clorophyll, when you look around and see something green you are probably looking at this),
- An energy transfer cascade from light to potential energy stored in molecules that culminates with the production of sugar.

And as a combustion engine, photosynthesis has many modifications and adaptations that can be done to this simple structure.

### Implementation of the concept

There are many combustion engine and even if some of them sound "better" than others, they are often build with a specific purpose and hardly interchangeable. Even if an F1 engine sounds better than a small city car engine. Though you would not move an F1 engine in a city car, a city car engine in a truck and a truck engine in an F1 car. None of the possible combination seems good.

So does photsynthesis. There are many photosynthesis, some sounds better than other. But indeed, in every plant, photosynthesis is optimized for the environmental conditions that that plant met during evolution and that it is likely to meet in the future. You would not move a model of photosynthesis from one plant to the other... Or would we?

Components of photosynthesis are adapted to the climate and the environment in which that plant evolved, and we could hardly do a better job then evolution. Those conditions include temperature, direct Sun exposure or underbrush, humid or dry weather, windy regions etc.

But most crops plant are cultivated in condition that are not exactly the ones in which they evolved. We could something by learning to fine tune photosynthesis in crops. And gain something means producing food with less water and less fertilizers.

As we know how to adapt engines to various task, could we do the same with photosynthesis?
