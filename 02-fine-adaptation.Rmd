# Fine Adaptation

While the main aspects of photosynthesis are the same in all plants, every plant adapts its leaves and its photosynthetic apparatus to specific environmental conditions.

The photosynthetic machinery is inside the leaf cells. The leaf structure protects the photosynthetic machinery from the surrounding environment, but this protection is limited. Since the photosynthetic machinery collects energy from sunlight, it must be exposed to the Sun and cannot be shaded. Also, since this machinery must collect carbon dioxide from the air, it cannot be fully protected from wind and dry weather. Some component of the machinery are also sensitive to temperature changes.

Sunlight intensity changes regularly and cycles throughout the day and the year. Wind, temperature, humidity also change, sometimes in an unexpected way. But most of the time those changes are expected and can be easily predicted. The range of atmospheric condition that we experience is generally defined by the climate area in which are situated. This climates area could be, for example, mediterranean, tropical, continental, subarctic etc.

To thrive, a plant must manage two different and connected aspects of adaptation:

- Every plant must adapt its leaves and photosynthetic machinery dynamically to ever changing sunlight intensity, air temperature and humidity during the day.

- Every plant species must adapt and finely tune its photosynthetic components stably to have them performing best at the range of environmental condition that it is likely to encounter. Namely the climate or microclimate under which that species evolved.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "World climate area. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate#/media/File:ClimateMap_World.png)"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/ClimateMap_World.png")
```

We are studying the second kind of adaptation, that causes every plant species to evolve small modification to its photosynthetic machinery in order to perform best in a defined range of sunlight intensity, temperature and humidity.

We study fine stable adaptation of photosynthesis for a simple reason: crop plants are often grown in environments and regions that are different from the one in which they evolved. If we understood how crop plants adapted to their original environments we would know how they could adapt and grow successfully in a new environment and under new condition. Adaptation and optimization of photosynthesis is considered a path toward growing healthy crop plants with less water and less fertilizers.

To understand adaptation, let's imagine photosynthesis as a combustion engine (it is not, or if possible photosynthesis is the opposite of a combustion engine, whatever an engine "burns", photosynthesis "unburns". Our combustion engines today burn very recent and very old products of photosynthesis. Besides comparing photosynthesis to an engine is reductive and it does not convey the wonder that we feel when we observe living organisms).

Anyway, let's imagine photosynthesis as a combustion engine. There are many combustion engines, the main concept is similar for all the engines, but every type of combustion engine is adapted and tuned for a specific purpose. You would not move an F1 car engine in a city car, a city car engine in a truck and a truck engine in an F1 car, none of those combination looks like a good idea. And it is too easy to say that one of those engine is better than the others, for example the F1 engine, every type combustion engine is adapted for a specific purpose and for specific conditions.

So does photosynthesis. There are many adaptations photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is optimized in every plant species for the environmental conditions that that plant met during evolution and that it is likely to meet in the future. You would not move a model of photosynthesis from one plant species to the other... Or would we?
